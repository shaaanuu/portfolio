    <h3>Operating System</h3>
    <p>
      I use <a href="https://nixos.org/" target="_blank">NixOS</a> btw...!
      I migrated from Arch Linux, loved it for the minimalism.
      But now I use NixOS for it's reproducibility. Had to do the migration cause
      I broke it more times then I fixed it.
    </p>
    <p>
      As a person who plays with the Operating System a lot, I've broken it many
      times and I'm sure I'll break it again in the future too. So I wanted a
      stable OS that I (hopefully) won't hurt back that much. So, NixOS it is...
    </p>
    <p>
      Within NixOS, I got <a href="https://github.com/WillPower3309/swayfx" target="_blank">SwayFX</a>, a
      tailing window manager in Wayland. For the file manager, <a href="https://github.com/sxyazi/yazi">Yazi</a> and
      <a href="https://github.com/neilbrown/thunar">Thunar</a> is the best. Zsh runs within <a href="https://alacritty.org">Alacritty</a> for the terminal. For the code editor, I use NeoVim and VS Code simultaneously.
    </p>
    <p>
      Addictionally, I use <a href="https://davatorium.github.io/rofi/">Rofi</a> app launcher. For the colorscheme, I only go with <a href="https://catppuccin.com/">Catppuccin Mocha</a>.
    </p>
    <p>
      You can see all my dots in here:
      <ul>
        <li><a href="https://github.com/shaaanuu/nixdots">Nixdots (wayland) - current</a></li>
        <li><a href="https://github.com/shaaanuu/dots">Arch (wayland)</a></li>
        <li><a href="https://github.com/shaaanuu/dotfiles">Arch + Debian (Xorg) - very old</a></li>
      </ul>
    </p>
    <h3>Devices</h3>
    <p>
      I got a beast Toshiba Satellite C850 series Laptop paired with an iPhone 6S Plus. Yeah, wierd combo, I know...
    </p>
    <p>
      The laptop is not that powerful and modern. But pairing it with Linux can even support flutter development smoothly.
      doesn't support virtual devices but physical device isn't that slow.
