    <h3>Operating System</h3>
    <p>
      I usually use Arch Craft for almost everything. It dual boots with Debian
      Linux (cutting edge distro + stable).
    </p>
    <p>
      The reason I dual boot is because of the unexpected behavior of the Arch.
      As a person who plays with the Operating System a lot, I've broken it many
      times and I'm sure I'll break it again in the future too. So I wanted a
      stable OS that I (hopefully) won't play with much. So, Arch as the main OS
      and Debian is there if anything goes wrong with Arch when time is ticking.
    </p>
    <p>
      Within Arch Craft, I have 2 window managers: For the tailing window
      manager, I got i3, and for the floating window manager, I got Openbox. For
      the file manager, Ranger and Thunar. ZSH runs within Alacritty for the
      terminal. For the code editor, I use NeoVim and VS Code simultaneously.
    </p>
    <p>
      Addictionally, I use Rofi app launcher and Dunst notification daemon
      without any configuration from Arch Craft pre-installed. For the color
      scheme, I only go with Catppuccin Mocha.
