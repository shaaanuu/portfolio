    <h3>Who am I?</h3>
    <p>
      I am Muhammed Shan, a curious polymath who is eager to know how certain
      things works as it is. I know react and Flutter, but mostly I prefer
      optimizing messy codes. Besides that, I love fine arts that hooks with my
      eyes, music that touches my soul, philosophy that fuels my overthinking.
    </p>
    <p>
      I know Flutter very deeply than react. For Flutter, I use BLoC, then try
      to write it mostly without any StatefulWidget. For react, I use Next.js
      only when necessary and prefer Vite usually. But if it's a very small
      project, I recommend myself to use a small framework like Waku. I prefer
      speed of the application rather than speed of the development.
    </p>
    <p>
      Since my childhood, I have been mesmerized by the world of hackers and
      hobbyists, and what they did with things that people thought were
      obsolete. I love the world of custom ROMs, Linux distros, Hackintosh,
      FOSS, etc. You can probably guess that I'm more into software than
      hardware.

    <h3>Leisure</h3>
    <p>
      I'm the kind of guy who gets bored easily. But whenever that happens, I
      always find a way to spike my dopamine back. I love listening to music,
      watching great films, reading books, and drinking a huge amount of tea and
      coffee. I often consume a lot of philosophical bites, whether from books,
      blogs, or even YouTube. After philosophy, I prefer reading non-fiction,
      like science, history, politics, self-help. I also enjoy fiction,
      including classics, sci-fi, and rom-coms.
    </p>
    <p>
      I watch almost all types of films despite the genre. I usually look at the
      story and directors/writers instead of the genre. Same goes for music too,
      I usally looks into the artist and the lyrics/vocals. When it comes to
      games, nothing spikes my dopamine like Minecraft and Chess does. But
      mostly you'll see me in front of my PC or inside a book.
    </p>
    <p>
      I also love arts. Fine arts. Not just the sculptures and paintings, but
      anything with refined design. Yep, I call it art. I see unique designs in
      cars, products, websites and apps as the examples for 'When craftmanship
      meets Art'. I adore unique designs, both digital and physical.

    <h3>Website</h3>
    <p>
      If you are familiar with basic web dev and have seen the source code of
      this site, you must be wondering why did I wrote this in pure HTMl, CSS
      and JS. I could have used one of the frameworks from tons out there, but
      this site is my personal space on the internet, and it reflects who I am.
      I don't want it to be bloated and slow.
    </p>
    <p>
      But, it doesn't matter. Nobody cares. After all, this is just a personal
      portfolio, not a huge project which have many collaborators.
