        <h3>Operating System</h3>
        <p>
          I usually use Arch Craft for almost everything. It dual boots with
          Debian Linux (cutting edge distro + stable).
        </p>
        <p>
          The reason I dual boot is because of the unexpected behavior of the
          Arch. As a person who plays with the Operating System a lot, I've
          broken it many times and I'm sure I'll break it again in the future
          too. So I wanted a stable OS that I (hopefully) won't play with much.
          So, Arch as the main OS and Debian is there if anything goes wrong
          with Arch when time is ticking.
        </p>
        <p>
          Within Arch Craft, I have 2 window managers: For the tailing window
          manager, I got i3, and for the floating window manager, I got Openbox.
          For the file manager, Ranger and Thunar. ZSH runs within Alacritty for
          the terminal. For the code editor, I use NeoVim and VS Code
          simultaneously.
        </p>
        <p>
          Addictionally, I use Rofi app launcher and Dunst notification daemon
          without any configuration from Arch Craft pre-installed. For the color
          scheme, I only go with Catppuccin Mocha.
