### **Hey, Iâ€™m Shaaanuu.**

_This is my simple portfolio, where I keep things clean and minimal, like the internet meant to be (Or atleast i believe)._

If you saw the code, you'll be like _"Wait, no framwork? Just plain HTML?"_. I get you, but i don't think it's necessary for a framework like react or svelt to power up a simple portfolio like this. Now you must be thinking _"Oh this dude don't know react (or any other framework)"_. Feel free to look at the git commits of this repo and you'll find that this site went from plain HTML to vite and nextjs, then back to the plain HTML (currently). I done this because i choose to and this is the fastest option for a simple website like this.
