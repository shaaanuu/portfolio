### **Hey, Iâ€™m Shaaanuu.**

_This is my simple portfolio, where I keep things clean and minimal, like the internet meant to be (or atleast I believe)._

If you saw the code, you'll be like _"Wait, no framwork?"_. I get you, but i don't think it's necessary for a framework like react or svelt to power up a simple portfolio like this. Now you must be thinking _"Oh this dude don't know react (or any other framework)"_. Feel free to look at the git commits of this repo and you'll find that this site went from plain HTML to vite and nextjs, and finally to 11ty. And from my experiance, a static site generator is better for a static website.
